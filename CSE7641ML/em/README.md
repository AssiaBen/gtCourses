#Text clustering with expectation maximization algorithm

The goal is to find how to group a set of different text documents based on their topics. 

The model is detailed in the following file : documentModel.pdf. 

Index : 
- documentModel.pdf : Exposes the model.
- mycluster.m : Implements the EM algorithm.
- AccMeasure.m : Computes an evaluation function.
