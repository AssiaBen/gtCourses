#autonomous driving

This project aims at programming a truck equipped with a metal detector on a lateral arm to autonomously navigate and detect mines ina  specific environment. 

My contribution is in the source file src/vrep_csv_driver.cpp and modification to the arm control nodes: nodes/vsv_arm_ik.py.
The rest of the code is provided by Professor CÃ©dric Pradalier.
